# Cyber Learnings With Chanpreet âœ¨

Diving into the world of cybersecurity learning via platforms like Hack The Box (HTB) and TryHackMe (THM) is an exhilarating journey. My approach to crafting write-ups and walkthroughs for machines on these platforms involves meticulous documentation and clarity. I aim to dissect each challenge methodically, starting with a comprehensive analysis of the machine's structure, vulnerabilities, and potential exploit paths. Through detailed step-by-step breakdowns, I intend to guide fellow learners in understanding the core concepts behind each hack. Emphasizing not just the solution, but the reasoning behind each action, I hope to foster a deeper comprehension of cybersecurity techniques.

Overall, my goal is to contribute to the community's collective learning and growth in the realm of cybersecurity.
